# Final Grade Project
A repository where I will include all the scripts used during the development of the final grade project. We divide the work done in the following steps:

<br/>

1. **First data visualization**
   *In this section we check the primary information we had about the variants contained in Pandora: maf, common variants with the available datasets, info of the common variants, differenciation of populations capacity of this variants...* 
   
   <br/>
   
2. **Pandora data preparation**
   *We extract the important information from the four tables given to us and preparation of the information of samples, SNPs, genotypes...*
   *We check the number of genes by chromosome and the position of the genes in the different chromosomes.*
      
   <br/>
   
3. **GCAT subset variants imputed**
   *We extract the variants of interest determined on the first data visualization from the four panels, taking the ones with the higher info.*
   
   <br/>
   
4. **Merge datasets**
   *We prepare the data from Pandora and from the Subset previously obtained in order to merge them into a unique file with the information of all the selected variants (13718) and all the samples (16545).
